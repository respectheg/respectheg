      <h3 class="titleleft">To celebrate, or not to celebrate.</h3>
        <p>Thanksgiving: a holiday sodden with tradition. The brisk fall air nips at your 
        nose as you walk up the steps lined with pumpkins leading to the warm glow inside. 
        A sensory overload as family members race to greet you. Smells of fresh baked apple 
        pie and roasting turkey fill your nostrils while laughter and football hum in the 
        background. Thanksgiving holds beloved memories and traditions families stand by. 
        A day for people to share what they are grateful for, for people to express their 
        gratitude to loved ones around them. Yet for Native Americans, Thanksgiving holds 
        a different, more somber significance.</p>
		<p>“I always joke that October through November hold the ‘Native American Triple 
		Crown’ – Columbus Day, Halloween, and Thanksgiving – all of which misrepresent Native
		Americans in some way,” said UW Madison’s School of Education assistant dean for 
		student diversity programs, Aaron Bird Bear.</p>
		<p>Thanksgiving: a holiday sodden with tradition. Yet, a nasty history for Native 
		Americans. Many forget to acknowledge the struggle Native Americans faced during 
		the colonization of their ancestors. They are reminded of the gruesome exile of 
		their people annually on this day. Getting swept up in the modern celebrations of 
		this national holiday, Thanksgiving has a dark history left silent during the 
		conversations around the table. Thanksgiving is unjustly celebrated without 
		understanding its history. Many have even come to mourn this day in respect of the 
		disturbing history many of us fail to recognize.</p>
		<p>In Elementary School, we are taught the English arrived in America on the Mayflower. 
		They land on the east coast, making friendly connections with indigenous people and feast 
		for three days in celebration of the Fall harvest.</p>
		<p>“And just as Christopher Columbus never set foot nor eye on the North American 
		continent, and yet somehow “discovered it,” the connection between 1621 Plymouth 
		and the US celebration of Thanksgiving is purely, but significantly, mythological,” 
		said Bird Bear.</p>
		<p>What they failed to teach our naive, innocent souls is the bloodbath of a war 
		that erupted between the two parties. They failed to teach us the colonization and 
		exploitation of the native people by the white settlers. A disturbing history left 
		untold, I will reveal the truth behind this holiday we ~celebrate~ every year.</p>
		<p>The year is 1620. The English Puritans have been struggling to practice their 
		faith legally. Wanting freedom from The Church of England, they set sail in September 
		across the Atlantic in hopes of religious autonomy in ‘the new world.’</p>
		<p>Winter quickly approached. Illness ran rampant amongst the colony. Half the 
		population of settlers died during their first winter on the Cape. Surrounding native 
		groups had lived in the area of the Plymouth Colony some 10,000 years before the 
		English settled. These people knew the land and environment well. Squanto, an 
		English-speaking Native American from the Patuxet tribe, who had been sold into 
		slavery in Spain but escaped to England to come back to his homeland, taught the 
		English how to plant corn and where to hunt and fish. Without these teachings, 
		the English would have never survived the winter.</p>
		<p>This sparked good relations between the English and the Natives for some time. 
		Together the Natives and the English collaborated on a feast, what we now recognize 
		as the first Thanksgiving. The two parties enjoyed an evening together, indulging 
		in their Fall harvests.</p>
		<p>Now this is where the story usually ends; the pilgrims and the Natives happily 
		feasting at a big table together with cornucopias decorating the table. Wrong. 
		Although this infamous moment shared between the settlers and the Natives showed 
		peace at the time, it does not disqualify their tensions from changing going forward. 
		Did you really expect colonists to peacefully coexist with native people and accept 
		their ways of life as equals to theirs? I didn’t think so.</p>
		<p>As the English got increasingly more comfortable with the area and their native 
		‘friends,’ the colonies began to expand. Natives began to grow concerned as more English 
		settlers arrived on ships and more land was being occupied by white settlements. 
		Promises and treaties made by colonists were broken. Interracial sensitivities 
		against the Natives grew. English culture dominated the Natives’. Tensions between 
		the neighboring groups rose.</p>
		<p>It is now 1675, 50 years since the first white settlements in the Plymouth Colony. 
		Tensions peaked when three men from the Wampanoag tribe were tried and killed in the 
		Plymouth Colony. Native Americans finally had enough. The ensuing conflict known 
		as the King Philip's War became the bloodiest conflict per capita in American history.</p>
		<p>The United Colonies banned together the largest colonial army of 1,000 militia 
		and 150 Indian allies. They rendezvoused in the Rhode Island territory to fight 
		against the largest surrounding Native American group, the Narragansetts. The war 
		began on a stormy winter night in the middle of December. The militia secretly 
		attacked the Narragansetts in their main fort. They set fire to the village, 
		destroying and killing everything in their path. The surrounding frozen swamp 
		served as a getaway for some lucky Narragansetts. However, 300 Narragansetts women, 
		children and the elderly were killed in the tyrannical ambush. Despite their 
		compromised forces, the Narragansetts did not let the English get away unscathed. 
		Over the next year, the two sides went back and forth burning, destroying, and 
		killing the opposing towns and villages. The English eventually killed the Native 
		American leader and mounted his head on a post for the next 25 years acting as a 
		warning against any other attacks against them by the natives.</p>
		<p>The bloodiest war in American history per capita. Six hundred English colonists 
		killed and twelve towns completely destroyed. Three thousand Native Americans killed 
		and many more captured and sent into slavery. The few remaining Native survivors were 
		forced off their lands by the expanding colonies.</p>
		<p>Yet, this war is rarely discussed. A horrific historical conflict left out of 
		school curriculums. Yes it is morbid. Yes it is disturbing. But it is history. 
		Something we cannot deny. Think about the Native American ancestral history completely 
		wiped out of history books? We are taught about the ~one~ time English colonists 
		were not imposing their white supremacy over Native Americans and we celebrate. We 
		forget the rest of Colonial - Native history native americans around the nation are 
		reminded of every year on Thanksgiving.</p>
		<p>“Thanksgiving attempts to obscure the brutality, direct warfare, reservation 
		internment, cultural genocide and genocide that were required to colonize the continent 
		through promoting a mythological holiday portraying American Indian and non-American
		Indian people who are happily getting along and ‘sharing,’” describes Bird Bear.</p>

      <h3 class="titleright">Wisconsin Supper Clubs</h3>
      <h1 class="subheads">Time Capsules of Retro Culture</h1>
        <p>From the quintessential relish trays to delicacies like ice cream cocktails, Wisconsin 
        supper clubs uphold tradition. Emerging in the Prohibition era of the 1930s, any supper 
        club will transport you right back into those original speakeasies. Essential qualities 
        like the retro decor to signature menu items distinguish supper clubs from an average 
        restaurant. Relish trays are the first priority. Decorated with hot peppers, radishes, 
        celery, carrots and green onions, the tray starts the meal off right. All-you-can-eat 
        soup and salad bars run the risk of ruining your appetite before the meal even starts. 
        Large cuts of meat like prime rib and thick cut steaks are washed down with muddled 
        brandy Old Fashioneds and brandy Alexanders for the entree portion. For supper club 
        regular Susan Becker, the ice cream drinks for dessert are a necessary sweet treat to 
        finish off the night.</p>
		<p>“Every place has their own idea of what they consider the best ice cream drink. 
		It depends on each individual,” Becker said. “For me, I love a super thick, almost 
		soft serve ice cream drink. I want it to stand up and peak.”</p>
		<p>These ice cream drinks, either minty or almond liqueur flavored, sometimes even 
		have a drizzle of chocolate syrup to coat the inside of the glass. Some places serve 
		theirs more like a milkshake, others are thick. Personal preference determines the best.</p>
		<p>The signature aesthetic of supper clubs compliments the featured food items. 
		Becker describes how supper clubs usually have an atmosphere straight out of the 
		50s, a blast from the past. The little old ladies playing the piano in the dining 
		room sets an ambient mood. The walls are covered with wood paneling or deep colored 
		wallpaper, creating a dark atmosphere throughout the restaurant.</p>
		<p>“Cloth table clothes with candles on each table, large wrap around bar with 
		upholstered bar stools, and the supper clubs to the far north typically display 
		taxidermy animals on their walls,” Becker explained.</p>
		<p>An extensive alcohol selection and the occasional view overlooking Lake Michigan 
		sets a classic backdrop. Retro lights and crystal chandeliers dimly light the 
		restaurant. Sometimes string lights add a twinkle to the room. Eating at a supper 
		club is a prolonged dining experience, lasting well over two hours to get through 
		all of the courses. With all these common characteristics, three specific restaurants 
		around Wisconsin have perfected their take on the true supper club experience.</p>
 		<p>The Hobnob in Kenosha sits on the shores of Lake Michigan where you can catch 
 		the sunset while sipping a cocktail at the bar. The retro neon sign outside attracts 
 		those looking for a classic supper club experience. Once inside, the large fake leather 
 		booths, dark persian rugs complimenting the burgundy wallpaper and relics from world 
 		travels decorate the various dining rooms. Crystal chandeliers radiate dim lighting 
 		for comfort while delving into their signature roasted duckling served a la orange. 
 		To finish the night off sweet, the Hobnob is known for their extra-thick grasshoppers.</p>
		<p>“Personally I think it’s the best because it’s super thick, and they even hand muddle 
		it; meaning they scoop the ice cream and muddle it, rather than using a blender, 
		and put it in the glass with the liquerer,” said Becker.</p>
		<p>Their ice cream drinks include 10 scoops of ice cream making for a peak towering 
		over the shallow glasses. Becker claims they are so big they can easily satisfy two 
		people.</p>
		<p>Jackson Grill, on Milwaukee’s industrial south side, brings us to another 
		quintessential supper club in a very unsuspecting neighborhood. The supper club, 
		once family home, located in a residential area feels like you are dining at your 
		neighbor’s house. However, the art-deco bar sets this restaurant apart from any 
		normal neighbor’s in-home bar.</p>
		<p>“I love the atmosphere. I love the bar, it’s very 50s.” Becker said. “They have 
		the back bar that lights up. It’s very intimate, they do not have a lot of tables.
		And the food is good with reasonable prices.”</p>
		<p>The small restaurant is run by owners with extensive culinary backgrounds, 
		offering their gourmet renditions of supper club classics. One of the featured 
		dishes includes charred steak topped with portobello mushrooms and whole garlic 
		cloves. Seared scallops over saffron risotto is another option to fire up the taste buds.</p>
		<p>“The chef comes out and talks to you at the end of the night when he is all 
		caught up,” Becker recalled, enhancing the unique intimacy.</p>
		<p>The Five O’clock Club has been around for over 70 years, and is known for serving 
		some of the best steaks in Milwaukee.</p>
		<p>“The steaks are phenomenal. They do something special with the steaks and they 
		are just so good,” said Becker. “It is a little pricey, but everything comes with 
		your meal. You get the bread, the relish tray and your salad.”</p>
		<p>About 10 years ago, Becker explained, they used to have servers come around the
		dining room with a cart carrying the table’s relish tray, salad and bread. Unfortunately 
		that tradition was put to rest. Yet, cozy ambience thrives from low ceilings decorated 
		with string lights amongst garland above the bar. Waitresses from the supper club 
		heydey really enhance the authentic experience.</p>
		<p>“I liked it because it’s so 50s. It’s super dark in the dining room. There’s 
		literally no windows,” Becker said. “There’s like red velvet wallpaper. Things haven’t 
		changed in probably 50 years. It’s gaudy, and I love it.”</p>
		<p>Their iconic Alley Cat Lounge, a luxury piano bar and lounge, brings in live 
		music every Friday for some entertainment over dinner. The historical background 
		of this supper club livens the supper club aesthetic.</p>
		<p>“It’s one of those places you should experience once in your lifetime,” said Becker.</p>
		<p>With over 350 supper clubs in Wisconsin alone, you will not have a problem finding 
		one of these time capsules wherever you may be. Yet, finding those with the best 
		steaks and ice cream drinks will entail some further investigation. People like 
		Susan Becker will continue to rave about the supper club experience even now after 
		the supper club era has become a time of the past. The rich food can be matched with a 
		full experience rich in American cultural history and authentic decor.</p>

      <h3 class="titleleft">The Power of Vulnerability</h3>
      	<p>The most profound relationships come when you least expect them. Back in May, I 
      	traveled through Ireland and Scotland with my best friend, Henry. We started in Dublin 
      	and went to Belfast, ferried over to Glasgow and finished in Edinburgh. We left each 
      	city in more awe than the last. Until we reached Glasgow, we did not know a soul in 
      	the places we were visiting. We kept social by going to pubs and concerts. Drinking 
      	pints and smoking cigarettes was the European pastime we inherited. When we got to 
      	Glasgow, however, we met up with Henry’s friend from home who goes to Glasgow Uni. 
      	Hoping for an insider’s look into the city, we reached out to Lily. Little did I 
      	know she was going to have a profound impact on me.</p>
	  	<p>The first night we linked with Lily, we met her at one of the classic student 
	  	spots on campus. We sat in the grass on a hillside drinking beer together, brushing 
	  	through all of the standard small talk “getting to know” one another, observing 
	  	the dynamic of Glasgow Uni life. She told us of a function that night her uni radio 
	  	station was hosting that she wanted to take us to.</p>
	  	<p>After walking under highways and through a water treatment facility, we were 
	  	approaching our destination. It was a very inconspicuous area of Glasgow, to say 
	  	the least. We were walking down an alley behind a group of people seemingly going 
	  	to the same place as us. They suddenly disappeared into an opening through some 
	  	bushes. Shocked, we followed. We were winding on a dirt path lit by candles hanging 
	  	in mason jars on the canopy of bushes above us. We had no idea what we were getting 
	  	ourselves into.</p>
	  	<p>The event turned out to be a compilation of DJs performing in an empty warehouse 
	  	in the boonies of Glasgow. At first we were the only people at the event. Little did
	  	we know Glasgowegians do not make their way out for their evening activities until 
	  	midnight at the earliest. But we didn’t let that postpone our fun — this gave Lily, 
	  	Henry and I time to really open up to one another.</p>
		<p>We sat on old spools circled together sharing stories and becoming ever more 
		comfortable with one another. We engaged in conversation with people around us. It 
		was a conglomerate of people from all over. Some from the UK, others from around 
		Europe. Some people did not even go to the uni. It was a bunch of students, outcasts 
		and friends who found their way to Glasgow.</p>
		<p>Eventually, conversations split and Lily and I caught ourselves in deep conversation. 
		We confided in one another. I was sharing information about myself I had never shared 
		with anyone so quickly. She felt comfortable enough with me to share her tough 
		experience being an international student. Making friends she really connected with 
		was a struggle she faced all year. She confessed how refreshing and thankful she 
		was to have become such good friends with me. She even showed me her personal music. 
		She let herself be vulnerable, allowing me to reciprocate the mutual appreciation 
		of her friendship to me. I found myself opening up to Lily in ways I do to my closest 
		friends who I’ve known for years. But I had known this girl for less than a day. 
		She would listen to me and I would listen to her, we would empathize with one another, 
		we would cheer each other on.</p>
		<p>We eventually ditched Henry to dance in the warehouse where the DJs were playing.
		We twirled one another like a married couple, laughed at each other like babies and 
		cared for each like best friends. We were in a setting neither of us had ever been 
		in, an environment unfamiliar to both of us. We allowed ourselves to become vulnerable, 
		quickly escalating our comfort with one another. This fostered a relationship we relied 
		on. Lily and I, we formed this mutual appreciation within the other that we continued 
		for the rest of our time together in Glasgow.</p>
		<p>Glasgow is known as a gritty city, and many people find it hard to see past its 
		rough exterior. High crime rates and a dark past give it a bad rap. Yet, I have such 
		fond memories of an unexpected friendship. Lily showed me the power of vulnerability 
		and how it can foster a relationship organically, forming a relationship from nothing
		to something beautiful. I have not seen Lily since, and do not know the next time I 
		will see Lily again, but I am so thankful for the friendship we had for those four 
		days.</p>

	  <h3 class="titleright">The Local Expert</h3>
	  <h1 class="subheads">Jonny Hunter's parallel values to Slow Food UW's mission</h1>
	    <p>From serving rice and beans in the basement of a church to becoming one of Madison’s 
	    most iconic culinary figures, Jonny Hunter’s social values parallel Slow Food UW’s 
	    (SFUW) action on campus.</p>
		<p>Hunter and SFUW  enact  similar ethics within their practices. Both seek to 
		educate people on our individual role and impact within the food system. Together 
		Hunter and SFUW work to provide insight and access to good, clean and fair food for all.</p>
		<p>While an undergraduate at UW-Madison, Hunter took over a coffee shop in the 
		basement of a church serving food to customers for just $3 every weekday during 
		the academic year. Simple, vegetarian ingredients comprised the menu. He coined 
		his operation The Catacombs.</p>
		<p>“When you’re on campus, you’re always trying to find who you are and what 
		communities you want to be a part of. And so we built this really strong, pretty 
		large community....Much of the way Slow Food runs,” Hunter says.</p>
		<p>Hunter humbly recognizes his influence on Slow Food. His start-up inspired the 
		introduction of the organization on campus.</p>
		<p>After losing access to the church space, Hunter and partners refused to settle, 
		thus The Underground Food Collective (UFC) was born. The UFC is comprised of a 
		restaurant, catering business, meat processing operation and a butcher shop. 
		Hunter’s strong value in ethical and sustainable sourcing practices and labor rights 
		are exhibited throughout the UFC.</p>
		<p>Hunter wanted to make change from the inside out by directly entering the food 
		system himself. He knew the power they had in choosing to process meat through an 
		ethical and sustainable lens. By processing meat correctly, prices rise, people will 
		buy less therefore less consumption.</p>
		<p>“We felt like we had to be in the meat processing business; not because we wanted 
		to celebrate meat, but rather we wanted to be a part of the food system. We wanted 
		to be a part of a better food system.”</p>
 		<p>SFUW articulates these similar values in their manifesto of providing good, 
 		clean and fair food for all. Both organizations create platforms for consumers to 
 		become aware and adopt similar practices in their everyday lives, developing a better 
 		industry for the future.</p>
		<p>Hunter has been a feature chef at least once every year running at SFUW’s Family 
		Dinner Nights. Hunter is passionate about the organization and what it provides for 
		students.</p>
		<p>“I think resources like Slow Food and how they are building a community and teach 
		people how to cook and also promote ideals, I think those are all really important. 
		The amount of students that have been touched by Slow Food and see that organizational 
		impact is just incredible.”</p>
		<p>Hunter and SFUW collaborate to exemplify the power within individuals’ decisions. 
		They help people make conscious decisions as consumers.</p>
	  </div>
	  
	  <div class="leftbody">
	  <h3 class="titleleft">A Basket of Resources</h3>
	    <p>The food industry in the United States has dramatically increased over the past 50 years. 
	    Fast food establishments specifically have doubled since 1970, reaching over 240,000 across 
	    the nation in 2018 (Statista and Obesity Action Coalition). The ‘fast life’ has created a 
	    dependency on cheap, fast food having detrimental effects on human health and the 
	    health of the environment. Approximately 33 percent of Americans have obesity. Consequently, 
	    300,000 people die a year from obesity (American Journal of Health Promotion). Limited 
	    access to healthy food sources inhibits people from their right to a healthy lifestyle.
		Slow Food UW (SFUW) works to combat the fast life through their mission of providing good, 
		clean and fair food to students and community members on and around campus.</p>
		<p>“In the name of productivity, the ‘fast-life’ has changed our lifestyle and now 
		threatens our environment and our land (and city) scapes. Slow Food is the alternative, 
		the avant-garde’s riposte,” says the founder of the Slow Food Movement Carlo Petrini in 
		the official  Slow Food International Manifesto. </p>
		<p>SFUW is just one ‘convivium,’ or chapter, within the  Slow Food International (SFI) 
		movement.  They use the SFI Manifesto as a foundation to promote the people, culture and 
		environment involved in food production ( SFI Statute ). A snail symbolizes the resistance
		against fast food; reestablishing the importance of sustainability within our food 
		industry. SFUW equips people tangible resources and beneficial skills to propagate 
		their values further.</p>
		<p>“I think across all different types of communities and demographics, I think it 
		[Slow Food] solely benefits...people in different ways,” says SFUW Co-Executive 
		Director Isabel Murkowski.</p>
     	<p>SFUW is a democratic, all-volunteer student organization. It is the largest 
     	collegiate chapter in America serving about 500 individual, locally sourced meals a 
     	week. The campus convivium started in 2007 by graduate student and Slow Food Madison 
     	member Genya Erling. The campus organization now has over 40 interns, a board of 
     	directors and  four core projects working to break the barrier between access and 
     	healthy food.</p>
		<p>“...one thing that our chapter does a really great job of...is really being in 
		line with our mission... I think foodie culture can be associated with expensive 
		products, high barriers, it’s kind of unique for a certain group of people, a certain 
		demographic... we want to stay true to that ‘for all’ aspect,” says SFUW Co-Executive 
		Director Camille Kelleher.</p>
		<p>Consumers, participants and external organizations reap benefits from their 
		interaction with SFUW. During the academic year 2014-15, the organization served 
		about 10,000 locally sourced meals and purchased $36,000 from local farmers and 
		merchants ( Zepeda & Reznickova 2016 ). The meals benefit consumers’ consumption 
		habits as well as the farmers, producers and chefs who get publicity and business.</p>
		<p>Various local restaurants are able to build their image throughout the city in a 
		unique way. Madison chefs bring awareness to the strength of eating locally and supporting 
		the community through sustainable decisions. SFUW and featured chefs honor similar 
		values that are especially emphasized when the organizations collaborate.</p>
		<p>“...when you buy local, [you’re] building your community. If you don’t have farms, 
		if you don’t have people that can build something that is beneficial for the community 
		and how they are participating in it, it becomes this void that is filled with greed 
		and the worst possible parts of capitalism.” says Madison chef Jonny Hunter.</p>
		<p>Interns and directors learn skills in cooking, logistics, finance, communications, 
		outreach, education and leadership (Zepeda & Reznickova 2016). Participants interact 
		with the organizational structure getting hands-on experience they can apply in future 
		careers. Working alongside professional chefs refines students’ skills and builds 
		confidence. Student members learn from taking on the 10 hour per week responsibility 
		on top of being full time students.</p>
		<p>“I think the strongest impact of it is the people who learn how to cook, the 
		friendships they make, and... what they learn. And then also the amount of responsibility. 
		Being in college and having to to plan meals for a couple hundred people. You know, 
		that’s not easy work. And then also building an organization and having the capacity...
		I think those are pretty incredible,” says Hunter.</p>
		<p>The core projects create an inclusive space for conversation open to various 
		perspectives. This ‘conviviality’ promotes awareness, sharing food with others and 
		the possibilities of sustainable food. Conviviality combats the anonymity within the 
		fast food industry. It surfaces the identity of all those involved along the chain of 
		consumption, prioritizing the importance of recognizing each member.</p>
		<p>Interaction between consumers and producers strengthens each convivia’s contribution 
		to a better food system. Consumers witness exactly what they are eating, where it came 
		from and who made their food. SFUW hopes to educate and disseminate skills for people 
		to become active participants in our food system rather than passive consumers 
		( SFI’s Central Role of Food ).</p>
		<p>Whether a member or a consumer, SFUW creates a platform for people to learn about 
		their role within the food industry. They can learn how to participate with a better 
		understanding of their individual impact.</p>
		“Everyone can contribute to Good, Clean and Fair quality through their individual 
		choices and individual behavior,” says the  SFI Good, Clean and Fair: the Slow Food 
		Manifesto for Quality. SFUW provides access to good, clean and fair food for all 
		across campus through a variety of initiatives celebrating the importance of sustainable 
		food. SFUW initiates a positive rapport between consumers and the food industry 
		ultimately contributing to a better future.</p>
		<p>“We just really want to get across that good food is for everyone, and it’s a 
		right, and we support that right,” says Murkowski.</p>

	  <h3 class="titleright">Ethnic Emporiums</h3> 
	    <p>Tamales from Mexico. Sushi from Japan. Pierogies from Poland. 
	    Food is huge part of any culture: it is a significant characteristic of what makes 
	    a culture unique to its people and region. Food brings people together, manifesting 
	    the culture and tradition of peoples. Recipes are passed down from generation to generation, 
	    upholding authentic family traditions.</p>
		<p>Ethnic grocery stores sustain specific culinary traditions, allowing them to thrive 
		outside of country lines. Madison is home to many of these cultural hubs from countries 
		around the world, and each one provides culturally specific ingredients. Specifically, 
		Asian markets dominate Madison’s ethnic grocery store scene, each providing their own 
		take on the necessities of Asian cuisine.</p>
		<p>J&P Fresh Market, located across the street from Woodman’s grocery store in west 
		Madison, has the best selection of frozen food, fresh seaweed, and snacks. Sharing 
		kitchen space with the Chinese restaurant next door, the owners also offer freshly 
		made savory Chinese steamed buns that we can’t resist.</p>
		<p>The Asian Midway Foods located on South Park St. has a wider selection of cold 
		drinks and produce. It is the closest option to campus, accessible by foot and bus. 
		The self-serve display case offers a wide range of baked sweets from the local Asian 
		Sweet Bakery nearby. Plus, their sesame balls and red bean cakes can quench any sweet 
		tooth craving.</p>
		<p>For a more Korean specific grocery store, Lee’s Oriental LLC on University Avenue, 
		across the street from Whole Foods, is easily accessible by bus. This tiny establishment

	  <h3 id="titlerightspringbreaksolace">Spring Break Solace</h3>
	    <p>Spring break is the time of year that companies and resorts look forward to. Like 
	    Valentine's Day, spring break has become another capitalistic holiday season companies 
	    can exploit travelers far and wide. As long as there is time-off and a destination, 
	    the act of spring break-ing will prevail.</p>
		<p>Rightfully so, most students look forward to spring break. A quick relief from 
		the semester, a chance to travel somewhere, a time to relax. I always await spring 
		break with great anticipation. My break was spent seeking solace away from the dreadful 
		Midwest winter. Even if it meant going out west to the mountains, at least there is 
		real snow and skiing. I was privileged enough to always have an opportunity to get 
		away for spring break. I never considered just staying at home for break, until this year.</p>
		<p>This semester has given me a new appreciation for my home. I have been worked 
		harder than ever before. Being a full time student, having a job, getting involved 
		in leadership positions, finding internships, researching study abroad, developing 
		your professional persona, all while trying to maintain a relationship and friendships 
		is a feat. Wanting to put 100 percent into each seems almost impossible when all are
		building intensity as the semester progresses. Work ethics get compromised, shortcuts 
		are taken, and final products do not turn out as well as you hoped when spread so thin. 
		This semester was all of this and more. I honestly have never been more challenged 
		academically, socially and mentally.</p>
		<p>By the time spring break came around, I was so exhausted from the semester that 
		traveling seemed like more work than not. I realized going home to my mom in Milwaukee, 
		to lay on my couch and take a breath was really what I needed. I needed to take a 
		step back, time to regroup after the semester of chaos.</p>
		<p>I had a hard time coming to terms with this idea initially:  not  wanting to go 
		on a vacation for once. I did not know how to articulate this feeling until I really
		allowed myself come to terms with not wanting to go anywhere  but  my home. The social 
		pressure of going on a luxurious vacation got to my head before I could listen to 
		what my body and mind really needed.</p>
		<p> I am extremely privileged to say that I have the  option  to travel or not. 
		Taking the liberty and self-awareness to know when you just need a break can give 
		spring break a whole new outlet to the ultimate relaxation. Instead of viewing staying 
		at home as mundane, see it as a time for a mental reframe, a meditation for a week. 
		Allowing myself to articulate a taboo liberated the standards I had on spring break. 
		I have learned accepting what is best for myself mentally and physically will bring 
		me most peace, even if that just entails the comfort of my own bed.</p>

	  <h3 id="titleleftconscious">Conscious Tourism</h3>
	    <p>Traveling is a way to see the world, experience different cultures and learn about 
	    yourself. However, traveling has major effects on our vacation destinations. As visitors, 
	    it is our responsibility to be aware that tourism has both positive and negative 
	    impacts on local communities and environments, and it is important to know how to 
	    treat them with respect.</p>
		<p>Some of the positive effects of tourism include job creation and increased revenue 
		coming into local areas. Tourists’ dollars can be used to protect natural landscapes 
		and aid impoverished areas. Shopping at local markets or smaller restaurants and paying 
		park entrance fees ensures that money goes directly to local businesses instead of 
		larger corporations. Respectfully taking part in traditional customs, like Flamenco 
		dancing or cooking classes to learn how to make local dishes, helps keep traditions 
		alive and build a better cultural understanding.</p>
		<p>Unfortunately, tourism can also cause various problems for local communities. 
		Tourism-related jobs are often seasonal and poorly-paid, and much of the money goes 
		to large travel or resort companies. A large influx of tourists damages the natural 
		environment with litter, footpath erosion or habitat destroyed for lodging. Tourism 
		can also drive out locals due to overcrowding or a higher cost of living from the 
		money visitors bring in. In some parts of the world, animal tourism is problematic 
		as well, with animals being drugged or taken from the wild for tourists’ amusement.</p>
		<p>To help combat some of these effects, do your research before traveling. For example, 
		if you plan on spending a lot of time outdoors, check how you can minimize environmental 
		damage, such as not using certain bug sprays or sunscreens in protected areas. Or if 
		you’re going to a country with elephants, find an elephant sanctuary that does not 
		offer riding. The best experiences come from keeping an open mind and being respectful 
		of local people and their cultures and traditions.</p>
