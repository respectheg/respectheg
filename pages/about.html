      <p><h5 id="description">A designer. A writer. An outdoors-woman. A traveler. A yogi.

My name is Genevieve Vahl, G for short. I have a passion for creating. Whether through magazine layouts, writing an article or taking on a new adventure, I make an active effort to expend my energy towards positive, constructive activities. I work to build myself up through projects I am proud of. Developing my artistic sense self has lead me on a brighter, healthier path of self worth. I have found my true passions through design and art.</p>

<p id="p2">After one semester of graphic design class my senior year of high school, I was hooked. I continued my new-found passion by self-teaching myself the Adobe Suite. Seeking input from the internet, peers and mentors, I have been able to master my craft within Adobe Suite. I intertwine Photoshop, Illustrator and InDesign to create my preferred art form: magazine layouts. 

I have cultivated a fiery obsession with magazines. I have found great power within these print publications. They are art within art. The publication skeleton is art in and of itself, displaying other written and visual art within its bounds. I have found a certain beauty within this mini gallery. This hobby has further developed my skills in writing and design. Writing will give me the in into the magazine industry. Then with my design skills, I hope to work on the layouts for progressive, art and culture focussed magazine publications. I even hope to one day create my own brand and magazine company.</p>
