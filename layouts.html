        <h5 class="layoutdescription">A mock magazine layout I made for a semester long research 
        project. I interviewed a local chef and icon around Madison, learning his story and 
        relating that to my project topic. We were then required to make a mock magazine layout 
        to showcase our interview story.</h5>

      <h3 id="layouttitlemke"> Milwaukee Zine</h3>
        <h5 id="layoutdescriptionmke"> <p>For my cartography class, we were given much freedom 
        in our final projects, as long as they included a map(s). Born and raised a proud Milwaukee-an, 
        I decoded to map my favorite areas of Milwaukee based on my most visited and most time spent in 
        the neighborhoods around the city. I created a zine incorporating maps I made on ArcGIS and 
        original, personal photos. The following magazine layouts are from this final project zine.</p>
