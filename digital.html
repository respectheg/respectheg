            <h5 id="workdescription"> I created these event posters for the annual Harvest 
          Fest hosted by a student organization on campus working on sustainable agriculture. 
          I created this using original photography I manipulated in Photoshop and curated the 
          piece in Illustrator. The event is held in the community garden on campus, thus I chose 
          earth tones and sepias to render the photos. I hoped to illicit a sense of Earth and 
          community in my work. It was a mixture of a band poster for the featured band, Bear in 
          the Forest, and a promotional poster for the event.</h5>

            <h5 id="dcad1description">I made some graphics for the Daily Cardinal, a student run 
            newspaper on campus, to recruit people to advertise in their paper. I used their colors
            and their logo within the design to incorporate their brand within their own ads.</h5>

              <h5 id="souvaddescription">Souvenirs accepts written and photography submissions for their 
            print editions of the magazine. As a part of the marketing team, I created several ads 
            publicizing the submission process. I made this ad meant for a half sheet of paper using 
            Adobe Illustrator. The photos are from previous years' submissions that I pulled style 
            inspiration for the ad from.</h5>

        <h3 id="africatitle">Political Map of Africa</h3>
          <h5 id="africadescription">An assignment for my cartography class was to either create a 
          political or terrain map of Africa. The point of the project was to demonstrate our knowledge 
          on placing labels. With a political map of a large continent, labeling is key. I chose to label 
          a political map of Africa. First rendered in ArcGIS, then imported and styled in Adobe Illustrator. 
          We were able to demonstrate a lot of skills with this project including color choice, font-family 
          choice, different uses of bolding and italics to differentiate features, point symbols to label 
          cities and features.</h5>

          <h5 id="sfuwinfographicdescription"><p>For my intensive journalism course, I did a semester long 
          research project on Slow Food on the UW Madison campus. This infographic delved into the 
          international Slow Food Movement that started in the Spanish Steps of Rome. I researched and created
          the facts presented.</p>
          <p>I made a timeline tracking the history of Slow Food on the UW Madison campus. The photos are from the Slow Food archive. 
          I used Adobe Illustrator to make the infographic and the timeline.</p></h5>

        <h3 id="shopsmalltitle">Shop Small Map</h3>
          <h5 id="shopsmalldescription"> For my cartography class, we were assigned a project to show our 
          ability to map graduated symbols. Graduated symbols show the increase in magnitude by increasing 
          the size of the point symbol. Here I chose to use graduated symbols showing the top ten cities 
          with the most small businesses in the US. Another requirement of the assignment was that the map 
          had to be in grey scale, limiting our reliance on color and focussing on the actual design of the 
          map and its data representation.</h5>

          <h5 id="wastedescription"> This map was testing our ability to create a choropleth map, meaning 
          showing how different areas compared to one another using color to compare the places. I chose to 
          map the amount of waste production on a global scale. I chose black and red to evoke a sense of 
          destruction and dark tones to this topic has it is having serious negative effects on our environment. 
          I chose to also showcase what types of waste is most prevalent, adding to my visual story.</h5>

        <h3 id="kaylacollagetitle">Kayla Kollage</h3>
          <h5 id="kaylacollagedescription">Technically created in a graphic design class, I created this collage
          with my dear friend Kayla as my protagonist. Collaging really encompasses my style as an artist. We were 
          to use original photos as well as scanned in objects that we photoshopped into our collages. I arranged 
          and scanned the ring of small red peppers and the strawberries which were from a table cloth I photoshopped 
          out. The photos were from a shoot we had in the freshman dorm laundry rooms. The stark contrasting colors
          of her red tube top and the bright teal walls caught out attention. Because I had so many photos from that
          shoot, I created this collage out of the several different shots I had.</h5>

       <h3 id="portraitcollagetitle">Portrait Collage</h3>
         <h5 id="portraitcollagedescription">In this point of my design career, I did not necessarily have my own style
         I would employ in my work. However, after making this piece, I really honed in my skill sets, what tools and imagery I 
         liked to use. I became quite fond of the clipping mask function on photoshop as well as finally employing the plethora of 
         flower photos I take and putting them to good use. Every image in this collage is my own. The photos of the bodies 
         are me, the backdrop is a zoomed in image of a sun set sky, the land is a clipping mask photo from my travels to Utah, 
         the red pepper ring is arranged, scanned in and photoshopped in, the flowers faces are my personal photos and the 
         half moon of orange flowers are scanned in off a cover of a notebook and photoshopped. This really jumpstarted my 
         style as an artist.</h5>
